Siddhartha is one of those rare books i would recommend to anyone, regardless of their background or belief. I've read it twice or thrice and each time it resonated with me even more deeply and remind me of its wisdom. Despite its simplicity in plot and language, this novel carries heavy philosophical and spiritual weight. 

The story follows Siddhartha, a Brahmin on a long journey in search of enlightenment. Interestingly, he finds it through many forms such as asceticism, indulgence, love, love and finally stillness. Additionally, he learns it through the cylical nature of life and each phase reveals a new layer of understanding about the world and the self. 

Herman Hesse's writing is lyrical and yet accessible. Its written beautifully and full of quiet wisdom that invites reflection. It doesnt preach. It lets you walk beside Siddhartha and let you draw your own conclusions. 

One chapter that statyed with me is "The Ferryman". Siddhartha meets a humble ferryman named Vasudeva. Unlike the scholars, ascetics or wealthy merchants Siddhartha had met before, the ferryman teaches without preaching. He listens more than he speaks, and his greatest teacher is the river. 

Through their conversation, Siddhartha begins to understand the timeless flow of life. He learns to listen not just to people but to the river itself which reflects a deepter truth about existence. The river becomes a metaphor for life, time, and the interconnectedness of all things. 

One of the most profound quotes from this chapter: 
> “That the river is everywhere at once, at the source and at the mouth, at the waterfall, at the ferry, at the rapids, in the sea, in the mountains, everywhere at once, and that there is only the present time for it—not the shadow of the past, not the shadow of the future?”

In this sense, the natural world becomes Siddhartha's guru. True wisdom often comes not from intellectual pursuit, but from observation, experience, and presence. 

Reading Siddhartha feels like meditating with words. It reminds you the path to peace and truth is often not linear. It's a book I know i will return again when life feels uncertain.
