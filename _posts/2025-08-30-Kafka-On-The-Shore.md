This is one of the most vivid book i have ever read. The writing is amazing and imaginative. It was recommended to me by a bookclub and from there i heard about Murakami. 

This book feels like I'm watching a movie series with a hook at the end of each episode. The book cover lots of theme such as spiritualism, love, surrealism and adventure. 

The main idea or theory that sets the event in the book comes from the idea of spiritual world and material world. Every soul has its other half and the soul will spend its entire life in the material world seeking for the other half. The book also talks about how a person's shadow can get "weak" when they cant find or lose the other half. In this case, Miss Saeki who is the other half of Kakfka and also in the same time, his mother figure, lost her lover in the past which led her to live a life where she blindly going through routines. While Mr Nakata, lost his first half when he entered the spiritual realm which led something else to enter and put him in between the spiritual real and material realm. This allowed him to talk to cats. 

There are many interpretation of the theory but this one to me fits the best. By far it is a very addictive book with interesting storyline that keep things vague and clear in the same time.
