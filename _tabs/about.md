> Hi, I’m Elvintiran Balan — a naturalist, researcher,and an adventurer.

My journey blends science and soul: I’m currently pursuing my Master’s research on insect ecology, particularly focusing on oil palm pests and biological control using barn owls, under the research group BORG (Barn Owl and Rodent Research Group). I’ve spent countless hours in the field observing life from the forest floor to the canopy — from the fungi that bloom after the rain to the birds that call at dawn. My love for the wild is more than academic; it’s deeply personal.

This site is a reflection of the things that move me — nature photography, book reflections, personal adventures, and the questions that keep me awake at night. I document the fungi, birds, reptiles, and insects I encounter not just for scientific curiosity, but to share the quiet beauty and wonder of the natural world.

When I'm not knee-deep in data or forest soil, I’m pushing my limits — whether that’s running marathons, rock climbing, diving, or dreaming of cycling across Southeast Asia. I believe that life is best lived close to the earth, with curiosity as our compass and courage in our stride.

I value simplicity, clarity, and honesty — in writing, in relationships, and in the way I navigate the world. I'm deeply interested in mindfulness, sustainable living, and building meaningful, fulfilling connections — both with people and places.
